    <h5>The classic South African dish</h5>

    <p>If you ever get a chance to attend a picnic or barbecue organised by a South African,
        you most likely will get the chance to sample
        one of South Africa’s favourite staple dishes.
    Pap, wors and chakalaka is a much loved dish in South Africa, it is made up of maize/corn flour (paste), wors (South African sausage) and chakalaka which is a side dish comprising, tomatoes, onions, garlic, black pepper and other ingredients listed in the recipe.
     This dish is eaten at all occasions, and the fact that it’s relatively inexpensive makes it a very popular dish among South Africans of all social economic backgrounds.</p>
        <p> If you are having pap, wors and chakalaka at a barbecue 
            then the most popular drink to accompany it will be a cold glass
            of beer and perhaps a cold glass of juice or fizzy drink for those under
             the age of 18 or anyone else who does not drink alcohol.</p>
